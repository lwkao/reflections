What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The programn creates a hidden folder, where it will keep all files
which are necessary to keep track of the older files.
Commits are NOT automaically made. we have to do it by ourselves.
We need to initialize the repository, or else it will be treated as a 
regular folder from windowns (no version control).




How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value 
do you think it offers?

The staging area is between the other two. 
Its is used as a box, where you can put everyhing you want to comit
together, and later decide if it will really be commited or not.
