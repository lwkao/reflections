What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The programn creates a hidden folder, where it will keep all files
which are necessary to keep track of the older files.
Commits are NOT automaically made. we have to do it by ourselves.
We need to initialize the repository, or else it will be treated as a 
regular folder from windowns (no version control).
